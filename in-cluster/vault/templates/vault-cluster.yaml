  # Ingress: 
  # we use AWS ALB ingress in production to expose vault to be accessed via DNS by other clusters 
  # For local env w/o DNS, do we still need ingress ? You don’t need it if you expose Vault’s port directly to your host using NodePort or Kind port mapping.
  # Because:
  #   vswh in the prod cluster can reach Vault at https://host.docker.internal:8200.
  #   No Ingress Controller or DNS resolution is necessary.
  #   Only keep NGINX Ingress if you want to practice ingress behavior or experiment with path rewriting and TLS termination.

    # host.docker.internal is the special DNS inside Docker that points to your macOS host.
    # When you expose port 8200 on your infra Kind node → your Mac (and other Docker containers) can access https://host.docker.internal:8200.
    # vswh in your prod Kind cluster (running in another container) can also reach that address.
    # Alternatively, you can use the IP address of your Mac (ifconfig | grep inet) if host.docker.internal doesn’t work in your Kind setup.
    #
    # api_addr is for Vault's Internal and External Communication
    # has two main roles:
    #   Client Redirection (HA): When a request hits a standby Vault node in an HA cluster (like your size: 3 setup), the standby node redirects the client to the active (leader) node. It uses the configured api_addr for this redirection.
    #   Advertised Address: It's the address Vault uses to advertise itself to other components, such as its own plugins or external clients, as the correct endpoint.
    
    #api_addr: https://host.docker.internal:8200
    
    # This value tells Vault what address other Vault pods should use when forming a cluster (Raft or HA mode).
    # When Vault runs with integrated storage (storage.raft), it forms a Raft cluster by connecting to each member’s cluster_addr.
    # Example:
    # Pod1 env: POD_NAME=vault-0
    # Pod2 env: POD_NAME=vault-1
    # So vault-0 announces https://vault-0:8201 and others join via that address.
    # This allows Vault peers to replicate storage and coordinate leader elections.
